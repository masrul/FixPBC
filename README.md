# FixPBC: Make macromoleucle whole 
Most of the time typical PBC algorithm works to make a macromolecule whole. But, if macromolecule is very large and long, typical PBC does not work, as distance between center of mass of molecule and end-atoms is larger than half of box length. Here, a new algorithm is devised to circumvent this issue. PBC is applied bond-by-bond to reconstract whole molecule. Molecule is represented as graph, and traverse order is generated by using breadth first search.
